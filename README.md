# Guessing Game

## About the Project
This project implements a simple number guessing game in Python. The game generates a random number within a user-specified range, and the player attempts to guess it. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## How It Works
1. The player sets the difficulty by specifying a maximum number.
2. The game generates a random number between 1 and the chosen maximum.
3. The player makes guesses, receiving feedback after each attempt.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/BernardoMarta/Guessing_game
cd Guessing_game


## Usage
Run the script from the command line:

python name.py


Follow the prompts to set the game's difficulty level and make your guesses.

## Example

**Input:**
When prompted, enter the maximum number for the range, then make your guesses.

**Output:**
The game will provide feedback on each guess until you correctly guess the number.

## Features
- Dynamic difficulty setting
- Random number generation
- Input validation
- Continuous gameplay until correct guess
